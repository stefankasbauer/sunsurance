# sunsurance

When I plan an outdoor activity I depend on the right weather. For example: If I have planned a sailing trip and a storm brews up, I may not be able to go because it is too dangerous. Finding an alternative on such short notice might prove very stressful and perhaps even impossible.
With Sunsurance my travel experience is saved! Thanks to realtime weather data and a smart contract I instantly receive compensation and recommendations for alternative activities on the spot without the need to make an insurance claim or prove that the weather is to blame as this information is already relayed by Sunsurance. And in this example, I get free entrance to the local Spa where I stay snug and warm.

## Additional value by blockchain technology

With the use of blockchain technology we create an awesome overall travel experience. Thanks to Sunsurance travellers can be more relaxed on holiday. They don't have to worry about bad weather because they receive instant compensation in the form of an alternative activity of the same value on the spot. This way one is less weather dependant and can for example relax in a spa instead of having to go back to the hotel room because of the cancelled sailing trip.

Thanks to blockchain technology, Sunsurance can be established as a peer-to-peer network, which means that the total amount paid by all travellers for the specific activity is used towards compensation, and little capital is needed for operating Sunsurance. Every traveller can take part through the use of micro-payments and rest assured that he will have an awesome travel experience. 

As opposed to other insurances, no processes for claim settlements are needed - which reduces expenses and costs dramatically.
